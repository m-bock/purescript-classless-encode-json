# purescript-classless-encode-json

This library applies the "classless" concept to Argonaout-style JSON encoding.

The encoding strategy for generic types is taken from [argonaut-codecs](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs)

Currently the [classless-arbitrary](https://github.com/thought2/purescript-classless-arbitrary) package is best documented and is recommended for getting started with the classless API concept. It will be helpful for understand this package, too.


## Installation
```
spago install classless
spago install classless-encode-json
```

## Documentation
Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](http://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-encode-json).
