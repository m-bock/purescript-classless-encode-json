# purescript-classless-encode-json


This library applies the "classless" concept to the encoding strategy implemented in [argonaout-generic](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-generic). Most of the encoding code is taken from there.
Currently the [classless-arbitrary](https://github.com/thought2/purescript-classless-arbitrary) package is best documented and is recommended for getting started with the classless API concept. It will be helpful for understand this package, too.
